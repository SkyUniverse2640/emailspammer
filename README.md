## Is our email secure using this program?

To minimalize risk, we suggest you to create a new Google Account and active the `Apps Password`
We do not steal any data, all of the entire code is OpenSources

## How to use?

First, you need to remember you must already set and get your own Apps Password
Second, setup the config with this command:

```
npm i
node .
```

"npm i" is to install the whole modules are needed, and "node ." is mean run the script "send.js"
